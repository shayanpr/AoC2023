# AoC2023
These are my attempts at solving the advent of code 2023. 

I'm not trying to get into the leaderboards, or even solve the codes in the day they come out. I will attempt to solve all of them, even if it takes more time.

Advent of Code is an annual coding event and a great way to improve your programming skills. I highly recommend everyone to give it a go. If you got stuck, you can see how I've done it. Better yet, you can check the reddit for better answers.
